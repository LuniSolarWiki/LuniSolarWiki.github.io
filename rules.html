                <h1><i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> Server Rules</h1>
                <p class="article-intro">Here is a comprehensive set of rules for Lunisolar. Following these ensures a fair and fun environment for everyone.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> Section 1: Chat & Community Rules</h2>
                    <p>These rules apply to all forms of in-game chat, signs, and Discord.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Be Respectful</h3>
                    <p>Harassment, bullying, hate speech (racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.), and excessive toxicity towards any player or group are not tolerated.</p>

                    <h3>No Spamming</h3>
                    <p>Do not spam the chat with repeated messages, excessive capital letters, or nonsensical text.</p>

                    <h3>No Advertising</h3>
                    <p>Do not advertise other Minecraft servers, Discord servers, or any external links (unless approved by staff).</p>

                    <h3>Keep it Family-Friendly</h3>
                    <p>Avoid excessive swearing, inappropriate topics, or any NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content.</p>

                    <h3>Language</h3>
                    <p>Please use English in the main public chat so our staff team can moderate effectively. You are free to use other languages in private/party messages.</p>

                    <h3>No Drama</h3>
                    <p>Do not start or escalate arguments in public chat. If you have an issue with a player, mute them or report it to staff. If you have an issue with staff, create a support ticket.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-island"></i> Section 2: Island & Gameplay Rules</h2>
                    <p>These rules govern how you play and interact with others.</p>

                    <h3>Griefing & Theft are Forbidden</h3>
                    <p>Do not break or place blocks on another player's island without their permission. Do not steal items from unlocked chests, farms, or item frames.</p>

                    <h3>Be Careful Who You Trust</h3>
                    <p>When you trust a player on your island (<code>/ob trust</code> or similar), you give them permission to build and break. <strong>Staff will NOT refund items or blocks if a trusted player griefs you.</strong> Trusting is your responsibility.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Scamming is Not Allowed</h3>
                    <p>Do not scam players during trades, in the Auction House, or by making false promises (e.g., "I'll give you a rank for 1 million"). All trades are final, but scams will be punished.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Island Name & Builds</h3>
                    <p>Inappropriate island names or offensive builds (e.g., pixel art) are not allowed and will be removed.</p>

                    <h3>PvP</h3>
                    <p>PvP is disabled except in designated PvP arenas (like <code>/warp pvp</code>).</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Section 3: Technical & Performance Rules</h2>
                    <p>These rules are crucial for keeping the server lag-free for everyone.</p>

                    <h3>No Lag Machines</h3>
                    <p>Intentionally building contraptions designed to lag or crash the server is a permanent-ban offense.</p>

                    <h3>Redstone Limits</h3>
                    <p>Keep your redstone reasonable. Avoid rapid-fire clocks (e.g., 0-tick or 1-tick clocks). If a staff member asks you to redesign or remove a laggy machine, you must comply.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Mob & Farm Limits</h3>
                    <p>Do not hoard excessive amounts of mobs. We recommend no more than <strong>50 mobs of one type</strong> in a small area. Use automatic-kill farms where possible.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Hoppers</h3>
                    <p>Do not use excessive hoppers. We recommend no more than <strong>100 hoppers</strong> on your island. Use water streams to transport items where possible.</p>
                    
                    <h3>AFK'ing is Allowed</h3>
                    <p>You are welcome to AFK at your farms or OneBlock generator.</p>

                    <h3>No Bypassing AFK-Kick</h3>
                    <p>Do not use AFK pools, macros, or scripts to prevent the server from kicking you for being idle. If you are AFK, you must be at your keyboard or AFK at your own farm.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-ban"></i> Section 4: Cheating & Exploits (Zero Tolerance)</h2>
                    <p>Breaking these rules will result in an immediate and likely permanent ban.</p>

                    <h3>No Hacked Clients</h3>
                    <p>Any form of hacked client is forbidden. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>X-Ray (textures or clients)</li>
                        <li>Kill-Aura / Forcefield</li>
                        <li>Fly / Speed / No-Clip</li>
                        <li>Auto-Clickers / Macros (for mining your OneBlock)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Allowed Mods</h3>
                    <p>You may use client-side mods that do not give you an unfair advantage.
                    <strong>Allowed:</strong> Optifine, Sodium, Shaders, Minimaps (without entity/player radar), Litematica (in schematic-only mode).
                    <strong>Not Allowed:</strong> Any mod that automates actions, shows player locations, or helps you find ores.</p>

                    <h3>No Bug Abuse</h3>
                    <p>Do not abuse any server or Minecraft bugs (e.g., item duplication). If you find a bug, report it to staff immediately. Abusing a bug is a bannable offense.</p>

                    <h3>No Alt Accounts</h3>
                    <p>You may only have one account on the server. Using alt accounts to bypass punishments, load extra farms, or boost your island is not allowed.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Section 5: Staff & Final Notes</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Staff Have the Final Say</h3>
                    <p>Respect all staff members. Arguing with, harassing, or lying to staff will only make your punishment worse.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Report Issues Correctly</h3>
                    <p>Use the proper channels (e.g., <code>/helpop</code>, Discord tickets) to report issues. Do not spam staff in private messages.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Rules Can Change</h3>
                    <p>These rules are subject to change at any time. It is your responsibility to stay updated.</p>

                    <h3>The Golden Rule</h3>
                    <p>The most important rule is use common sense. If you think something might be against the rules, it probably is.</p>

                    <blockquote class="rule-disclaimer">
                        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Punishments are issued at staff discretion and will escalate based on the severity and a player's history. (e.g., Warning -> Mute -> Kick -> Temp-Ban -> Permanent Ban)
